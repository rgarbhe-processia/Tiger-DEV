/**
 * The class that implement this interface have the ability to monitor the progress
 * of upload and download files in the FtpBean.<br>
 * You can pass the object which implement this interface to some put/get methods
 * of the FtpBean object. So that when there are any bytes read from the server,
 * the byteRead(int) method of the object you passed is invoked. And the byteWrite(int)
 * method is invoked when any bytes is written to the server side.<br>
 * A sample code is like this:
 * <font size="2">
 * <pre>
 * // Begin, this class implements the FtpObserver interface
 * class Sample implements FtpObserver
 * {
 *
 *     // Skip constructors and many things for simple
 *
 *     public void download()
 *     {
 *         try
 *         {
 *             // Pass this object which implements FtpObserver interface to the method
 *             ftpbean.getBinaryFile("remotefile", "localfile", this);
 *         } catch(Exception e)
 *         {
 *             System.out.println("Exception!!!");
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     public void byteRead(int bytes)
 *     {
 *         System.out.println(bytes + " new bytes are read.");
 *     }
 *
 *     public void byteWrite(int bytes)
 *     {
 *         System.out.println(bytes + " new bytes are written to server.");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
